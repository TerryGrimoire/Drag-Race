It is said that Marie Amtoinette (queen of France) herself said that about her people when there were starving and asking for bread. Being in Austria (her home country) and being French myself, I had to do something about these famous quote. I decided to make it gay and changeed it to let them eat c♥ck ! "

        slogan : "Kan mi kok ek saucisse, Boucané rest pandillé",
        text: "For the first time ever in its herstory, the island of La Reunion was having its first pride parade. For this occasion, I left my entire life in Canada, my appartment, my boyfriend and travel back to my home prouder and gayer than ever. It was such a powerful experience as we were making HERSTORY. This parade was important as there is still so much queer phobia in La Reunion. My slogan was inspired by a popular reunionnese expression 'Kan mi coz ek saucisse, boucané reste pandillé' , which means when I talk with the saucisses, the bacons stay hanging at their place. Basically, mind your own business. Obvisouly, I changed it and made it gayer as usual, transforming the verb talking into f*cking and that was a powerful message."

        text: "This pride was celebrated on the day of my 27th birthday. I realised how lucky I was, because I usually live in countries where I can be myself whenever I want. I no longer have to hide, I no longer have to be afraid to shine. For this, I created my own garnement, all made of sequeens. The idea was simple : I WANNA SHINE FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T !",

        text: "Brokeback Mountain... This movie is definitely my favourite movie of all time. It pains me each time I watch but still, I cannot help myself. I wanted to represent all of the people in the world that are still living in this reality. All of those who need a place like Brokeback Mountain to love. I wish to live in a world where there is no more secret in Brokeback Mountain. I want the world to know that I will no longer hide or pretend."
